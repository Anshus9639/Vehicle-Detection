# How to Contribute to this Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Vehicle Detection project! Any help is greatly appreciated.

## Contributing Datasets
The most valuable way to contribute right now is by providing more high-quality, annotated data. This will help make the model more robust and accurate.

### What We're Looking For
We are especially looking for "hard examples" where the current model struggles. This includes:

- 🌃 Images of traffic at **night** or in low-light conditions.
- 🌫️ Images in **bad weather** (rain, fog).
-  densely **crowded scenes** with many overlapping vehicles.
- 🙈 **Partially occluded vehicles** (e.g., a car partially hidden behind a tree).
- 📐 Vehicles from **unusual angles**.

### Required Format
To make the data usable, please provide annotations in one of the following formats:

1.  **A link to a public Roboflow project** (this is the easiest!).
2.  A downloadable folder of images with annotations in **YOLO TXT format**.

### How to Submit
1.  Please **do not** submit a pull request with the data directly.
2.  Instead, **open a new GitHub Issue**.
3.  In the issue, provide a brief description of your dataset and a link to where it can be accessed (e.g., your Roboflow project or a Google Drive link).

## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features
If you find a bug in the code or have an idea for a new feature, please open a GitHub Issue and describe it in detail.

Thank you again for your help!
